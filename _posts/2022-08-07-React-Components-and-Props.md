## What Are Components?
Lets take a look at Youtube as an example. If you take a look at the screen when you are watching a video, you'll see that the display, or App, can be divided into sections that display different data in similar formats: 
App
- Left: Main Video 
- Right: Suggested Video
- Bottom: Comments

### Right: Suggested Video

If you take a look at the right hand side of the screen, you'll see the suggested video pane. You can keep scrolling down and more videos will populate. This component can be treated as a list. You'll also notice that within this component, you can see there is an iteration of a same type of component in the form of a card. A way to handle this list is to iterate in a for loop.
