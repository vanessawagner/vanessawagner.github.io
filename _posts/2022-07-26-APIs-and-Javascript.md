## How to Use Javascript to Use API Data

Today we will work through how to pull API Data into Javascript. 

The first thing we need to do is call the fetch function with an argument identifying the path to the resource. 
Next, you need to work with the response which is a stream of data that returns a promise. 
Complete data and grab the data in the body of the response. We need to read that data and store it in a format that we can work with (text, image data coming as a blob, array, JSON or Javascript Object Notation). 
Make an img HTML DOM Element with that data.

```
test code
```
